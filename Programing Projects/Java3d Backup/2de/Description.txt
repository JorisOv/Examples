Hanim 7 renders a simple avatar, made out of spheres and cylinders, with a limited
amount of animation. At present the only animation is the waving of the right arm 
of the avater, activated by keypress.

The general idea is to use implementations of the "Joint" and "Segment" interfaces,
in our case named "JointAdapter" and "SegmentAdapter".
In the "joints" rotation, translation and scaling is applied, while the Segments 
contain the "objects" to be rendered. We don't directly add the objects, but have
a method that creates "limbs"; a sphere and cylinder in one group, scaled to the
proportions given to the method. (The limbs have no lighting or texture.)

The joints are the "glue" that sets the whole skeleton up. In our procedure we create
these joints (and their corresponding segment) in one go. Only after every part
has been created and initialized, we put the "skeleton" together (from bottom-up).

The animation is done by using two "Behaviours". These behaviours have a reference to
transform group in the joint, that takes care of the scaling and rotation.
After a keypress, the matrix representing the rotation is adjusted. After one 
"adjustment" has been made, the other behaviour becomes active.
